My Zabbix Templates

I am trying to follow goods standards here and my triggers are based on this: https://rklein.com.br/images/matriz_gravidade.png (sorry, pt_BR) <br>
If you have issues or ideas, please get in touch. <br>
<br>
And *NO*, I dont like to use trappers, only UserParameter with ACTIVE items. <br>
All my templates are designed to work with Zabbix 3+, sorry if you are still in 1.x or 2.x. <br>
